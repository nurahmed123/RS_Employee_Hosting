### **🚀 Jetsu: A YSWS Robotics Program**



#### **What is Jetsu?**

Jetsu is a cutting-edge robotics program that empowers participants to build AI-powered robots with financial support. The goal is to inspire innovation, originality, and hands-on learning in robotics and machine learning.

----------

## **🛠 How It Works**

Participants will receive funding to build their own robots. But before that, they need to complete two key steps:

✅ **Submit a Bill of Materials (BOM):**

-   A detailed list of all components needed for their robot.
    
-   The total cost must be under **$100**.
    

✅ **Publish an Initial Machine Learning Project on GitHub:**

-   A well-documented repository demonstrating their ML skills.
    
-   This will serve as proof of expertise before funding is provided.
    

----------

## **🔹 Development Process**

### **Machine Learning Models**

-   Participants must train and develop their models **on their own laptops** to control their robots.
    

### **Originality & Accountability**

-   **WakaTime** will track coding activity to ensure authenticity.
    
-   A **detailed project journal** must be maintained to log work hours and progress.
    

### **AI Assistance**

-   Tools like **GitHub Copilot** are allowed, but **projects must be self-made and plagiarism-free**.
    

### **Open-Source Contribution**

-   To qualify for funding, **all projects must be open-source** and publicly available.
    

----------

## **🎯 Rewards & Incentives**

Participants who successfully complete their projects will receive:

🎁 **Jetson Nano Developer Kit (4GB)** – For all participants who complete their project.

🎁 **NVIDIA Jetson Orin (8GB)** – For those who **log 100+ hours** of development and improvements.
